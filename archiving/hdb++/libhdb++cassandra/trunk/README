To compile this library, you will need to download and install the DataStax Cassandra C++ Driver ( https://github.com/datastax/cpp-driver ).
The Makefile assumes that by default, the cassandra driver root directory is ../../cassandra/cppDriver/
This version was tested with Cassandra 2.2.4 and 2.2.6 and with the version 2.2.1 of the Datastax Cassandra C++ driver and with its dependency with libuv version 1.4.2.
This version is compatible with libhdb++ library version 4.

You will need to update ../../Make-hdb++ file in order to update CASSANDRA_INC and CASSANDRA_LIB variables to point to the directory where the Datastax c++ driver is installed.
This version requires a schema having a ttl column in att_conf table.
You can add this column simply by executing the following CQL commands using cqlsh for instance:

USE hdb;
ALTER TABLE att_conf ADD ttl int;
